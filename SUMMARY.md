## Today's Learning Summary

We covered React's hooks and also learned how to use custom hooks to enhance our application.

**useCallback** - Learned to optimize function memoization for better performance  
**useMemo** - Mastered expensive computation caching and object memoization  
**useContext** - Implemented global state management without prop drilling  
**Custom Hooks** - Built reusable useFetch hook with TypeScript generics  
**Error Boundaries** - Created robust error handling for component failures



Then we made a real application that combined all these concepts into a GitHub profile search app.
